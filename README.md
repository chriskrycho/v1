# v2.chriskrycho.com

The version of my website that was live in 2011, archived as v1.chriskrycho.com for a semi-permanent record. (You know, until the hosting goes offline!)

Not especially interesting in its own right, though it does serve as something of a window into the internet past. Look at that snazzy jQuery! And relatively early use of web fonts!
